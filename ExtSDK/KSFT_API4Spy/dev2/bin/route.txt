#   Abilities are a set of required abilities that the user or request must possess.
#   The abilities, extensions, methods and redirect keywords may use comma separated tokens to express a set of 
#       required options, or use "|" separated tokens for a set of alternative options. This implements AND/OR.
#   The protocol keyword may be set to http or https
#   Multiple redirect fields are permissable
